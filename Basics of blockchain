Blockchain definition:
Blockchain is a shared, immutable(can't be changed) ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.
An asset can be tangible(that can be seen to exist) (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).

WHY BLOCKCHAIN IS IMPORTANT?
Blockchain is ideal for delivering business information because it provides 
immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger
that can be accessed only by permissioned network members.

KEY ELEMENTS OF BLOCKCHAIN:

  a. Distributed ledger technology :
     A distributed ledger is a type of database that is shared, replicated, and synchronized among the members of a decentralized network.
     The distributed ledger records the transactions, such as the exchange of assets or data, among the participants in the network.
  b. Immutable records :
     No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded to the shared ledger. 
  c. Smart contracts 
     To speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract — is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically.
     A smart contract can define conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.
