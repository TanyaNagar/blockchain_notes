Blockchain definition:
Blockchain is a shared, immutable(can't be changed) ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.
An asset can be tangible(that can be seen to exist) (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).

WHY BLOCKCHAIN IS IMPORTANT?
Blockchain is ideal for delivering business information because it provides 
immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger
that can be accessed only by permissioned network members.
